//C++ STL
//Competitive programming
//limited size
//Standard template library
//library of generic classes and functions
//better not to reinvent wheel


/* Components:
1.Container :object that stores data .eg.vector,uses template classes
2.Algorithms:sorting,searching,use template functions(procedure to store data)
3.Iterators:object points to element in a container,handled just like pointers,
connects algo with containers
