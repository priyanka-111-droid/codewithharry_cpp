polymorphism
-eg multi-purpose nail-cutter(use as cutter,knife)etc.
-one name,may forms

1.compile-time poly/static binding:compile-time pe decides kaunse function will be called,compiler knows 
it has to run this function or operator during function call it binds that func to object,achieved by:
i)function overloading
ii)operator overloading

2.run-time polymorphism/late-binding :code dekhkar compiler does not decide.When code runs,it decides what function to bind
/that is, object calls which function
i)virtual functions
