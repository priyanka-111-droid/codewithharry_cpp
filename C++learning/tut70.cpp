/*
C++ STL:containers:

1.Sequence container-->linear fashion-->eg. vector,list,deque
2.Associative container-->direct access(tree)-->eg.set,multiset,map,multimap
3.Derived container-->give few good methods,model real world->eg.stack,queue,priority-queue

When to use what?
1.Sequence container:
i)Vector
->RA=Fast
->Insertion/deletion=Slow
->insertion at end=Fast

ii)List
->RA=Slow
->Insertion/deletion=Fast
->Insertion/deletion at end=Fast

2.Associative container:
All operations fast EXCEPT RANDOM EXCESS as tree data structure

3.Derived container:
depends on data structures
