/*Why Inheritance:
1.reusability important in OOP
2.In C++,we can reuse class,add more features in it
3.Reusing classes saves time and money
4.Reusing already tested and debugged class saves lot of time and effort of 
developing and debugging same stuff again.
-------------------------------------------
What is inheritance?
1.supports reusability in c++
2.reuse properties of base class for new class(derived class)
3.saves time and money
-------------------------------------------
Types of inheritance
1.Single inheritance-->derived class ,1 base class
2.Multiple inheritance-->derived class ,more than 1 base class
3.Hierarchial inheritance-->several derived classes from single base class
4.Multilevel inheritance-->deriving class from already derived class
5.Hybrid inheritance-->multiple inh+multi level inh,class derived
from two classes as in multiple inheritance,but one of parents
not a base class.
